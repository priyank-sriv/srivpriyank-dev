***Dear reader***,

**a bit off** is a *coder's log* - the idea is to help future me revisit stuff that I might have unlearnt along the way, intentionally or unintentionally. Why's it public? Well, I'm hoping there are people out there who may find it useful, which means I'll make an effort to not suck! 

The content encompasses stuff that I ***learn*** in my day job as a developer, or pursuits outside of it.

In my posts, I'm either sharing things that worked for me, or things that I'm doing for the first time (don't worry, there'll be enough warnings for you to tread carefully). Either way, it's an opportunity for me to learn and improve, so comments and criticism, hopefully well meaning, are welcome.
